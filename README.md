# LSP-vetur

WARNING: Vetur and thus also this package is no longer maintained so it's recommended to migrate to [`LSP-volar`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-volar).

This is a helper package that automatically installs and updates the [Vue Language Server](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/) (Vetur) for you.

To use this package, you must have the [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) package installed as well.

### Installation

* Install [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP)
* Install [Vue Syntax Highlight](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Vue%20Syntax%20Highlight)
* Install `LSP-vetur` from Package Control.
* Restart Sublime.

### Configuration

Open configuration file using command palette with `Preferences: LSP-vetur Settings` command or opening it from the Sublime menu (`Preferences > Package Settings > LSP > Servers > LSP-vetur`).

See also the documentation for the underlaying `Vetur` server that provides all the features: https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/
